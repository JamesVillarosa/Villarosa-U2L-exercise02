Steps on how I created my Github page:
1. I first create the navigation bar by creating a flex box and my info in it. Then design the bar after I included all the necessary content.
2. I included my photo. I customized the the photo will get smaller together when the web browser get smaller.
3. I screenshoot my previous works and include it in my Github page. I included a flex in it so the pictures will automatically adjust when the browser get smaller.
4. I wrote my skills and autobiography. Put them in a separate div/flex item and put them together in one flex container
5. I create my own logo. With my details shown, I put them beside my logo in the footer flex box.
